## Ames Housing Data
You have just joined a new "full stack" real estate company in Ames, Iowa. The strategy of the firm is two-fold:
  * Own the entire process from the purchase of the land all the way to sale of the house, and anything in between.
  * Use statistical analysis to optimize investment and maximize return.

The company is still small, and though investment is substantial the short-term goals of the company are more oriented towards purchasing existing houses and flipping them as opposed to constructing entirely new houses. That being said, the company has access to a large construction workforce operating at rock-bottom prices.

## Estimating the value of homes from fixed characteristics
Your superiors have outlined this year's strategy for the company:
  * Develop an algorithm to reliably estimate the value of residential houses based on fixed characteristics.
  * Identify characteristics of houses that the company can cost-effectively change/renovate with their construction team.
  * Evaluate the mean dollar value of different renovations.

## Determine any value of changeable property characteristics unexplained by the fixed ones
Now that you have a model that estimates the price of a house based on its static characteristics, we can move forward with part 2 and 3 of the plan: what are the costs/benefits of quality, condition, and renovations?

There are two specific requirements for these estimates:
  * The estimates of effects must be in terms of dollars added or subtracted from the house value. 
  * The effects must be on the variance in price remaining from the first model.

## What property characteristics predict an "abnormal" sale?
Your task:
  * Determine which features predict the Abnorml category in the SaleCondition feature.
  * Justify your results.
